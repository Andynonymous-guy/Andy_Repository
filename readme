'''Thanks to https://github.com/joelibaceta/triangulator.git for the triangulator. 
  Thank you to Tech With Tim from youtube for demonstrating how to make Corner detections found in polygonator using OpenCV.


I have no idea how different files can interact so I threw everything into a single file, Main.py and ran it as one function lol.  
Whoever happens to find this, if you want to use it for your own then here are the steps. 

1. Create a png image of the outline of the shape you want to bash similar to the one in Outline.png, I used a skier.
2. Run the Main.py file on your Python interpreter and replace the function call at the very bottom with the file name you want. 
3. Wait 10 seconds and hope the deprecation errors don't blow up the program. 
4. It will output the relative coordinates of the centroid and also draw the centroid onto the original image using the same coordinate system.
